				<h3>"I think it's really important to think outsideof the box when you're coding"</h3>
				<p>words by marc newson</p>

			<article id="secondA">
				<p>When you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead? Software continues to transform the world in remarkable ways and developers are at the center of it. At CodeMesh 2017 we invite you to join us in Sofia to learn about latest new technologies and exciting plans on the horizon. As always, CodeMesh is filled with strong technical sessions as well as opportunities to meet and learn from others in the industry. We’ll make sure the schedule is filled with solid content, and will strive to deliver some fun surprises along the way.</p>
